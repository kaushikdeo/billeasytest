**Note: Git Practices followed**

You will notice that I have followed proper git practices while developing the test app.
I have created master and dev branchs.
All the code in the master branch is production code
All the code in dev branch is developement code.
I have made multiple branches according to tasks and merged into dev branch from time to time
I havent deleted any of the branches even after the pull request into dev for your assessment.
